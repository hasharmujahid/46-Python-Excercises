# Exercise 35 - International Civil Aviation Organization The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
# alphabet assigns code words to the letters of the English alphabet acrophonically (Alfa for A, Bravo for B,
# etc.) so that critical combinations of letters (and numbers) can be pronounced and understood by those who transmit
# and receive voice messages by radio or telephone regardless of their native language, especially when the safety of
# navigation or persons is essential. Here is a Python dictionary covering one version of the ICAO alphabet:
#

#
# Your task in this exercise is to write a procedure speak_ICAO() able to translate any text (i.e. any string) into
# spoken ICAO words. You need to import at least two libraries: os and time. On a mac, you have access to the system
# TTS (Text-To-Speech) as follows: os.system('say ' + msg), where msg is the string to be spoken. (Under UNIX/Linux
# and Windows, something similar might exist.) Apart from the text to be spoken, your procedure also needs to accept
# two additional parameters: a float indicating the length of the pause between each spoken ICAO word, and a float
# indicating the length of the pause between each word spoken.
import time, os
